# Problem Statement
In this assignment, you have to design a restaurant listing page similar to Swiggy/Zomato website (E.g. https://www.swiggy.com/restaurants). 

## Tasks Breakup

- **Task 1** : Build a UI for collecting the following details from the user : 
  - The value/amount which must be the converted
  - The input/source currency corresponding to the amount
  - The output/destination currency in which the amount must be returned

- **Task 2** : Once you get the details from the user, use an API call to get the exachage rates (https://exchangeratesapi.io/). 

  - You can also hardcode the exachage value for a pair of currencies. Create a function which accepts the input & output currencies and provides the exachage rate for the combination

- **Task 3** : Compute the value/amount in the output currency and display it to the user.
